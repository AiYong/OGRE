OGRE
====

OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented,
flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive
for developers to produce applications utilizing hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.
The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries
like Direct3D, OpenGL and OpenGL ES and provides an interface based on world objects 
and other intuitive classes.
